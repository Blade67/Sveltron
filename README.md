# Sveltron boilerplate

This is a boilerplate for [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) using [ElectronJS](https://electronjs.com/), with SASS as preprocessor.

To create a new project based on this boilerplate:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Blade67/Sveltron
```

*Note that you will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed.*


## Get started

Install the dependencies...

```bash
cd Sveltron
npm install
```

...then start everything with [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org):

```bash
npm run dev
```

Your app should now be up and running! Edit a component file in `src` and your app in the `main.js`, save it, and reload (CTRL+R) the app to see your changes.

## SASS/SCSS
**This has only been tested with VS Code, mileage may vary!**
If you'd rather use SASS instead of SCSS, change `<style type="text/scss">` to `<style type="text/sass">` in your `src/App.svelte`, or remove the `type` tag entirely, to use vanilla CSS.

*Note you might need to add `"svelte.language-server.runtime": "file:///path/to/your/node.exe"` to your VS Code preferences if you're using the Svelte extension, and want propper syntax highlighting.*


## Compile app

The app is designed for quick prototyping using Svelte, thus building the app is up to you.
